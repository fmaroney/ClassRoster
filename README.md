This is your first homework assignment for the Spider coding workshops. Perform the following steps:
1) Submit a pull request for this project. 
2) Create a branch using your initials
3) Add some text to this file! Either just type "hello" or send me a message :)
4) Commit and push your changes to your branch on the remote repository.
5) You can check whether you were successful by looking at the project on Github and seeing if your branch is there!
